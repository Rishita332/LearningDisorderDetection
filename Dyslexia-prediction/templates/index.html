        Learning disabilities are disorders that affect the ability to understand or use spoken or written language, do
        mathematical calculations, coordinate movements, or direct attention. Learning disabilities have nothing to do
        with
        how smart a person is. Rather, a person with a learning disability may just see, hear, or understand things
        differently.
        That can make everyday tasks, such as studying for a test or staying focused in class, much more difficult.
        There
        are strategies a person can learn to make it easier
        to cope with these differences.<br>
        It's important to note that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders are
        not
        the same as learning disabilities. There are many different kinds of learning disabilities, and they can affect
        people differently. </br>

        We have developed Machine Learning Models to test whether your child has a learning disability or not. Take the given survey and then ask your child to take the respective quiz as per recommendation. <br>
